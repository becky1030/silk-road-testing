In the Indian Ocean, it was limited to the port of Basra.<br><br>In general, naval infrastructure in the Indian Ocean was lacking. The Ottomans and Portuguese appeared to have been the only professional naval forces around. The Mameluke Sultanate, which controlled the Red Sea, apparently had to order pre-assembled galleys and carracks from Venice to participate in the Battle of Diu. Shipbuilding is knowledge-intensive and easily bottlenecked industry, and the lack of warship-building tradition in the Indian Ocean meant that the Ottomans were as constrained as the Portuguese there.<br><br>In the end, the two powers came to an agreement over which ports each controlled. The Ottomans retained Basra, which seemed to satisfy them. It has to be noted that during this timeframe, (1500-1550), the Ottoman Empire was involved in several large land wars. They conquered the Mameluke Sultanate, Hungary, and defeated Safavid Persia. These commitments likely limited their investment into the Indian Ocean Fleet.<br><br>Finally, there was Venice's involvement. The Ottoman government's revenue was mainly tax-based, the income from trade tariffs was relatively minor and it did not \"sell\" trade rights to the Far East like the Portuguese. So their losses from Portuguese expansion were not much in monetary terms. For the Venetians however, the diversion of trade from the Indian Ocean had much more impact. They had a big hand in anti-Portuguese activities, like the preassembled galleys I mentioned, as well as negotiating a return to overland routes in Central Asia. They were decently successful, as their spice imports through Mediterranean ports had returned to acceptable levels by the 1550s.<br><br>As always, war is politics by other means.", "Taxila lay at the crossroads of three major trade routes": null, "Photo from": null, "In case you are wondering what Far Western China looks today": null, "s expedition maps": null, "Google Streetview": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 47.8096383, 30.5063805 ] } }
